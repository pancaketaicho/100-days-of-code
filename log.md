# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 12, 2019, Friday
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Restarted FreeCodeCamp's curriculum, working through Basic HTML and HTML5 and halfway through Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** It feels good to feel like I'm learning.

### Day 2: April 13, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. Finished Basic CSS and most of Applied Visual Design. Wrapping my mind around the CSS heart shape exercise was fulfilling.

**Thoughts:** I doubt whether or not I'll really be able to see this through. For the first time in a long time I'm going to have to resolve to see something through to the end over a long period of time.

### Day 3: April 14, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Visual Design and most of Applied Accessibility in freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I'm recalling most of the lessons, but I need to try coding each example from scratch by looking only at the end result and then reverse-coding it. I think that will really help my brain wrap around each concept. I also found a nice Medium article from freeCodeCamp about supplements and a study guide for fCC's curriculum. 

### Day 4: April 15, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Accessibility, CSS Flexbox, and most of CSS Grid in freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Today felt kind of slow going. I'm still getting used to the early mornings, but I think I'm also anxious to "get on with it" and move on to more interesting "challenges". To be fair, from a coding perspective, the bite-sized fCC exercises are very easy. Once I finish CSS Grid and move on to the Responsive Web Design Project, I'm going to take time and practice the skills reviewed up to that point by using other sources from a study guide article I found on Medium from fCC, as well as W3 School exercises (HTML and CSS).

### Day 5: April 16, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked up to the Responsive Web Design projects. I'm going to work through this guide from this fCC Medium article before I move on: “A practical guide to learning front end development for beginners” by Nikita Rudenko https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-practical-guide-to-learning-front-end-development-for-beginners-da6516505e41

**Thoughts:** I did some more research on W3Schools and their certifications. The concensus seems to be that the certs aren't worth it at all and will most likely get your resume thrown in the trash. FreeCodeCamp seems to have a much better reputation by a landslide, so that takes W3Schools off the table for me. I completed Flexbox Froggy, a web game linked to from the fCC Medium article. It familiarized me more with Flexbox. The final level, level 24, turned my brain inside out for a bit.

### Day 6: April 17, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the supplemental material from the beginner's front end developer article from the yesterday. Set up VS Code and got familiar with some shortcuts, learned a few terminal commands, and started working through the HTML & CSS tutorial from Interneting is Hard (linked in the aforementioned article).

**Thoughts:** Today was a huge step in setting up my environment. I'd actually had VS Code downloaded from a long time ago (which I believe was from a suggestion on a Traversy Media video), but today I finally started using it in conjunction with the HTML/CSS tutorial from IiH and started developing some muscle memory. I had to use Google to learn the VS/Microsoft versions of commands in the tutorial (and a command line video - which was done on a Mac terminal).

### Day 7: April 18, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the Interneting is Hard HTML and CSS tutorial on VS Code. Got about halfway through the second chapter. Very slow progress. Felt tired.

**Thoughts:** I didn't feel like I was mentally present while I was working through the tutorial. So far this was the least productive day I think. I'll try not to dwell too much on it. Just don't think too hard about it and move on to tomorrow.

### Day 8: April 19, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Interneting is Hard's HTML & CSS tutorial up through chapter 4: Hello, CSS. Learned how to link style sheets. Getting used to having everything working together in a code editor (VS Code).

**Thoughts:** Today felt better than yesterday. It was great to finally learn how to link stylesheets, something that was referenced in fCC's CSS tutorials but never told how to implement (probably because fCC uses a WYSIWYG interface instead of having you do the work through a code editor/IDE).

### Day 9: April 20, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through Interneting is Hard's HTML & CSS tutorial up through chapter 5: CSS Box Model. Late practice and slow progress today. Feeling more comfortable with margins and padding.

**Thoughts:** Today was long and I didn't get started on my daily coding until late, past 11 o'clock. Really tired and struggled to stay focused.

### Day 10: April 21, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chapter 5: CSS Box Model of Interneting is Hard's HTML & CSS tutorial and started Chapter 6: CSS Selectors.

**Thoughts:** Today was long and I didn't get started on my daily coding until late, again. I'm really liking the Interneting is Hard tutorial. I think it's a very good and important second pass at the info presented in fCC's Responsive Web Design tutorial. Put another way, fCC's tutorial tells you what an onion is, what a knife is, what a pot and a stove is, etc., and they even show you pictures of them, but IiH actually gets you going hands-on in a kitchen setting up your space, cutting the ingredients, setting the heat, and cooking the food like you would in real life.

### Day 11: April 22, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Nearing the end of Chapter 6: CSS Selectors of Interneting is Hard's HTML & CSS tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Not a bad day. Took an important call from my brother during my morning practice, so I had to make up for the lost time before bed. I prefer getting my practice in earlier in the day, before I'm tired. Today's learning was nice. I'm getting more acquainted with selectors, specificity, and syntax, as well as becoming more comfortable with the concepts than I was before. I'm starting to worry that my progress is slow and I'm not putting enough work in. I might need to cut some things back.

### Day 12: April 22, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chapter 6: CSS Selectors of IiH's HTML & CSS tutorial and started working through Chapter 7: Floats.

**Thoughts:** Today was okay. Really busy, but I was able to inch forward with a little progress.

### Day 12: April 23, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chapter 7: Floats and started working through Chapter 8: Flexbox of IiH's HTML & CSS tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Another good day. I'm averaging about a chapter a day with Interneting is Hard's HTML & CSS is Hard tutorial. I'm moving slow and not really producing anything. I'm wanting to finish this tutorial before I move on with freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certifications. I think most of the time I'm just deluding myself, and I think I'm using this 100 Day of Code challenge to rationalize it. Meaning, inside I don't really have a self-starter mentality - I just do a bunch of little tasks that make me feel like I'm accomplishing something (i.e. tutorials) but never produce something original. That being said, though, I do enjoy tutorials because, to put it simply, I'm learning things I didn't know before and am filling gaps in my knowledge. I should probably work faster through the tutorials and solidify my understanding by trying to implement what I've learned in an original project.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
