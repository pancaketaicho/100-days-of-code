# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 12, 2019, Friday
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Restarted FreeCodeCamp's curriculum, working through Basic HTML and HTML5 and halfway through Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** It feels good to feel like I'm learning.

### Day 1: April 13, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. Finished Basic CSS and most of Applied Visual Design. Wrapping my mind around the CSS heart shape exercise was fulfilling.

**Thoughts** I doubt whether or not I'll really be able to see this through. For the first time in a long time I'm going to have to resolve to see something through to the end over a long period of time.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
